Deep Learning Game of Thrones Subtitles

Data is coming. Game of Thrones (GOT) is getting more and more interesting and I thought that a machine should not miss out on all the fun. So here’s the way I taught a machine the Game of Phrases –

1. Scraped all the subtitle (.srt) files from the internet till Season 5.
2. Lords of Text Analytics processed all the text to make some sense out of it.
3. One True Algorithm was implemented to teach Mr. Machine all he should know.

I was itching to use word2vec on some dataset and this looked like the perfect match. Here’s the Wikipedia definition –
"Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce so-called word embedding. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words: the network is shown a word, and must guess which words occurred in adjacent positions in an input text"
